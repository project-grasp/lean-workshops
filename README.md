Built using Sphinx and restructured text. Forked from [leanprover/theorem-proving-in-lean](https://github.com/leanprover/theorem_proving_in_lean). Special thanks to Gabriel Ebner for writing pygments code highlighter for lean, and other authors of "Theorem Proving In Lean" for the inspiration behind this tutorial, as well as Skyscanner for funding the creation of this tutorial as part of their "One Day" initiative.
